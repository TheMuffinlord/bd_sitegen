# bd_sitegen

site generator for boot.dev lesson. expect this to go private when i'm done.

the content is honestly kinda cringe but i didn't write it. i don't even like lord of the rings that much. i like it a small amount. i saw most of the movies. they were fine but very long.

## lessons learned

* recursion sucks _(but sometimes it's the only way to get things done)_
* fix your gitignore early
* flatten every list all the time oh my god
